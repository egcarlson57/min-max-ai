Final Project Proposal

Topic: Computer with intelligence

Game: Connect 4

Interface library: graphics.py

Class:
    • Pieces
        ◦ Location (x,y)
        ◦ Color (string)
    • Board
        ◦ Size (x,y) - 6x7
        ◦ Where the pieces are (using matrix)
    • Game
        ◦ Human, AI playing options (both)
        ◦ Win/Lose result determination (PNMA)
        ◦ Interface with graphics.py

AI strategies
    • Value Heuristic to evaluate which possible moves among the 7 should be played
        ◦ For every move, pretend the move has been played and use PNMA
    • Tree search
        ◦ Recurse through the Value Heuristics to determine the best move

Prime number masking algorithm (PNMA):
    • Use prime number mask to –
    • Determine in a board state and assign a score
        ◦ Length of connections (the greater the better)
        ◦ Number of connections (the greater the better)
    • Additional considerations
        ◦ Spaces around connections (the greater the better)
        ◦ Edge cases where you can’t win (minimize edge cases)
        ◦ Gap cases which may result in a connection (the greater the better)
